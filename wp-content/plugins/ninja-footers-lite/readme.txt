Create customizable footers for your posts.

== Description ==
[Ninja Footers](http://www.samurai9design.com/ninja-footers/) is an internal linking tool that let's you add customizable & clickable footers to all of your WordPress posts. 

Post footers should be an essential part of any WordPress blog's design.  Post footers can help any blog reach it's potential by providing 4 measureable assets:

**1. Internal Linking** By adding clickable links that redirect users to other parts of your website you can drastically improve your website Search Engine Optimization.  By installing Ninja Footers you can automatically add post footers to all of your previous blog entries. A site with 50 existing posts will instantly have an additional 50 links directing users and Google toward toward the page or post of your choice..  The impact of Ninja Footers can often be seen and tracked almost immediately in respects to website's Google's page ranking.   

**2. Easier Site Navigation** By adding custom page footers to your WordPress blog you can send engaged readers to the exact page or post of your choice.  You know your blog and the content it contains but your readers may not.  A customizable post footer gives you the power to direct readers towards the content that they will find most valuable. 

As an added benefit, multiple page views will reduce your website's bounce rate.  A lower bounce rate let's Google know that your site has valuable content.  Google's main function is to assist users in finding the information they are looking for. Bounce rate is one of the many variables they consider when determining page ranking by making your site easier to navigate you help your readers, Google and your site's SEO.

**3. Keywords & Anchor Text** Ninja Footers is fully customizable.  This gives you an extra opportunity to add keywords to every post in your blog.  If your anchor text (the clickable part)  uses your keywords, you can increase the impact of your post footers dramatically.  Including keywords in the anchor text lets Google know what your "target page" is about which then makes it easier for Google to send relevant readers to your site. 

**4. Increased Conversion** Pop-ups that "fire" the second you visit a site can be annoying.  However, if a reader has made it to the end a blog post it is fair to assume they are an engaged reader.  The post footer is a perfect place to add a conversion opportunity.  Whether it be a mailing list Optin form or an invitation to follow one of your social media channels, there is no better spot than directly after you have already provided your audience information they find valuable.  Post footers can dramatically help almost any WordPress website.  They help your readers navigate your site, Google understand your site, give you an extra customer conversion opportunity and can play an essential role in your site's SEO strategy.
